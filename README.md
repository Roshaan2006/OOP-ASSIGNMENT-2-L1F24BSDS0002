🏢 TechSolutions Employee Management System (C++ OOP Project)
📘 Project Description

This project simulates a simple Employee Management System for a company named TechSolutions using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++.
It demonstrates key OOP concepts such as constructors, copy constructors, static members, const functions, this pointer, dynamic object handling, and deep vs shallow copy — all implemented in a clean and easy-to-understand manner.

⚙️ Features

Stores employee details (Name, ID, Salary)

Uses constructor initializer list for data initialization

Demonstrates a deep copy and shallow copy

Uses static and const members for company info and employee count

Implements dynamic object creation and deletion

Shows object passing and returning

Provides clear console output separating each concept

🧩 Object-Oriented Concepts Used
Concept	Description
Constructor & Initializer List	Initializes employee data members.
Copy Constructor	Performs a deep copy to avoid shared memory.
Destructor	Frees dynamically allocated memory.
Static Members	Tracks total employees and holds company name.
Const Member Function	Displays data without modifying the object.
This Pointer	Used implicitly to distinguish between parameters and class members.
Dynamic Allocation	Demonstrated using new and delete.
Passing & Returning Objects	Shows how objects are handled as function arguments and return values.
Shallow vs Deep Copy	Illustrates memory management differences after deleting the original object.

🧠 Learning Outcome

This project helps understand:

The difference between shallow and deep copies.

Safe and efficient memory management in C++.

The importance of constructors and destructors in object lifecycles.

Proper use of static, const, and dynamic concepts in real-world OOP.
