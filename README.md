# 🏢 TechSolutions Employee Management System (C++ OOP Project)

## 📘 Project Description
This project simulates a simple **Employee Management System** for a company named **TechSolutions** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in C++.

It demonstrates key OOP concepts such as **constructors**, **copy constructors**, **static members**, **const functions**, **this pointer**, **dynamic object handling**, and **deep vs shallow copy** — all written in simple and readable C++.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Stores employee details: name, ID, and salary  
- Uses **constructor initializer list** for clean initialization  
- Demonstrates **deep copy** and **shallow copy**  
- Implements **static and const members** for shared data  
- Shows **dynamic object creation and deletion**  
- Demonstrates **object passing and returning**  
- Produces **clear and separated console output**

## 🧩 Object-Oriented Concepts Used

| Concept | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Constructor & Initializer List** | Initializes employee data members at object creation. |
| **Copy Constructor** | Performs a deep copy to prevent shared memory. |
| **Destructor** | Frees dynamically allocated memory. |
| **Static Members** | Tracks total employees and holds company name. |
| **Const Member Function** | Displays data without modifying the object. |
| **This Pointer** | Used implicitly to distinguish between parameters and class members. |
| **Dynamic Allocation** | Demonstrated using `new` and `delete`. |
| **Passing & Returning Objects** | Shows how objects are passed and returned by value. |
| **Shallow vs Deep Copy** | Illustrates memory management differences. |
